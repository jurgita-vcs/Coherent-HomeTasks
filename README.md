# Task 01

<b> Task 1 </b>

Create a console application, which asks the user for two integers a and b (assume that the user enters integers without errors). 

The application then prints out all integers in the range from a (inclusive) to b (inclusive) that have exactly two 2's in the ir ternary numbersystem(0,1,2) representation.
Develop a console application that implements the specified functionality.

<i> Note: to convert a string s to an int value, use the <tt>int.Parse(s)</tt> method. </i>
